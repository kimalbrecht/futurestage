		<spantitolo> PERFORMANCE <br> IS A HUMAN RIGHT </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p> 
		Performance isn’t a commodity. It isn’t a luxury. It isn’t something that gets added
		on top of the flow of life. It doesn’t belong to the ether, to the state or to private funders.
		It doesn’t belong to the places where it’s performed.
		</p>
	
		<p class="indent-all"> Whether it assumes the form of a streetside improvisation 
		or a formal staging of a consecrated work from centuries past, 
		it belongs to <span>the moment.</span>
		</p>
	
		<p> Performance is interstitial and conjunctive: it’s forever 
		emergent, performed afresh in the act of performing. It’s an 
		enactment involving sounds, sights, smells, bodies, spaces, time, 
		and touch. Far from standing apart, it is <span>virtuously entangled</span> 
		with every other art, from the spatial to the visual.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> Performance is a <span>fluid edifice built out of interactions</span>:
		between performer, production team, and audience;
 		between nature and culture; between human
		and machine; between architecture and living beings.
		</p>
		
		<p> Performance is a <span>human need</span>: for freedom of expression, for forms of fantasy 
		and make-believe, for a deepened sense of individual and collective belonging, for the 
		shared experiences upon which communities and commonalities are built. In the hierarchy 
		of essential human needs, it provides the tools for self-actualization, self-esteem, a sense 
		of intimacy and of social interconnection within communities and among communities.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> Performance is a human right. Not in the familiar Enlightenment sense that too
		often has smuggled homogenizing realities into universalist ideals at the expense
		of indigenous cultures and colonized or disenfranchised peoples. It is a “right”
		freighted with universals and with critical questions such as: how might a right 
		to performance build on, refine, critique, or repair the postwar human-rights
		conversation? How does that right scale across the spectrum of the arts from
		dance to opera, music to theatre, video to streaming media, or with respect 
		to bottom up vs. top down models of culture? How might it intersect not just the
		local publics and practices that make up the world of performance but serve
		as a bridge across peoples, cultures, social classes, and generations? 
		How might it more equitably translate into a system of property rights for 
		performers and creators?
		</p>
		
		<p> Because performance is a human right, the right to perform 
		and to experience performance must become <span>an integral part 
		of policy planning and economic life</span> embedded into the social fabric of public spaces and civic discourse, especially
		now as the world grapples with the trauma of pandemic losses 
		and the need to rebuild a new sense of local and global community and a shared responsibility for the destiny of the planet. 
		Likewise, as regards educational policy: no child’s education 
		should be considered complete if they haven’t experienced 
		the performing arts that are integral to their culture.

			<spantitolo> CONNECTIVE ARCHITECTURES </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p> 
		Because performance is a fundamental aspect of society, the “stage” (conventionally 
		understood) is only the most visible, formal outcropping of the multitude of stages that 
		characterize the life of a community at a given time and place. This is why the future stage
		cannot be partitioned off or solely aligned with models of performance that were forged 
		in the recent or remote historical past. This is why <span>the future stage needs to be intimately 
		entangled with the other stages on which contemporary life is performed</span>, from the streets 
		and sidewalks to Tiktok and Zoom to the workplace to cultural festivals and fairs.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		Dedicated spaces that support on-site modes of performance cannot, thus, 
		be just the stages of the past. They must serve as connective tissue between 
		the intramural and the extramural, between the past, present, and future, 
		between the onsite and the online. Their physical structure necessarily reflects 
		this connective identity, even when a given mode of performance may choose 
		to eschew the digital.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		What does such a theater or performance space look like? 
		What shape should it assume? A multitude of shapes that are site
		-and context- and genre-specific.
		</p>
		
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		In setting A, the future stage is <span>a broadcasting laboratory</span> that 
		builds on the past century of laboratory theaters, communal 
		gatherings, and rituals. In setting B it’s <span>a production studio</span> where 
		the audience is front and back, side to side, on stage and off stage, onsite and online. In setting C it’s <span>an interactive, participatory 
		playground</span> where the real is layered with virtual illusions and dreams. In setting D it’s a <span>distributed “space”</span> that resides only in the cloud where artificial intelligence is the storyteller and only virtual reality persists. In setting E it’s <span>the animation of indoor and outdoor spaces</span> conceived without any reference to becoming stages. In setting F 
		it’s <span>a stage of the mind</span>, with no need of any other incarnation.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		There’s no one answer.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		But it’s not enough either to replicate traditional forms or to simply build black
		boxes, leaving to the future the task of filling them in.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		New theater architectures need to place bets and those bets will be
		<span>interconnected, transmedial, and transcultural.</span>

		<spantitolo> LIVENESS PLUS </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p> 
		Among the stages that most powerfully shape contemporary life are those
		associated with the ubiquity of networks and networked devices, and the many
		ways in which they are reshaping the contours of human experience and
		interaction. Whether for performers or audiences, the resulting halo of data
		streams and algorithms that now surround, inform, and emanate from every
		human act demands an <span>expanded notion of live performance</span>:
		what we are calling liveness plus.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		“Liveness” can and must remain an essential attribute of all 
		spectacle forms both past and present. But “liveness” on the future 
		stage means grappling with the when, what, and where of 
		performance under conditions that blur the boundaries <span>between 
		presence and tele-presence</span>, between the embodied and the 
		mediated, between human actions and flows of data, between 
		consciousness and the metaverse.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		This expanded mode of staging can no longer be understood 
		as an afterthought. Rather, it entails the opening up of 
		new horizons of experience for audiences and performers: 
		experiences from hitherto unimaginable angles, and 
		on hitherto unimaginable perceptual or time scales; 
		<span>events designed to add value to each and every channel 
		that structures the experience.</span>
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		Liveness plus not only needs to be <span>hard-wired into every 
		future stage</span>, but implies new management, programming, 
		and business models; new models of inclusivity, access, 
		and outreach; new governance and ownership models, 
		as well as legal frameworks. It implies new modes of training 
		for performers that grapples with the changing nature of 
		performance itself and the attenuating boundary between performers and audiences. It implies a rethinking of such basic features of artistic practice and the arts economy as the tour.

		<spantitolo> THE TOURING <br> TEST </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		Touring remains one of the pillars of the modern performance economy. But touring 
		is less a human right than a necessity for performers who, due to the expanding 
		role of labels, publishers, galleries, streaming services, and other intermediaries, 
		cannot survive on the basis of sales of tickets and recordings alone. This must change.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
		The harsh realities of climate change demand new models of program
		development, sharing, sustenance, and distribution… <span>a reinvention of the tour</span>, a
		reimagining of how we ensure the free movement of ideas and culture across
		national borders. They suggest that touring, as currently understood, must
		increasingly become the exception rather than the rule. They demand innovative
		redefinitions of touring: <span>agile, low cost, telematic, multi-sited</span> modes of
		performance; cross-border collaborations that leverage the power of digital
		platforms; performances devised and bundled up so that they can travel from site to site and company to company with sharply reduced human travel; 
		performer residencies in a concentrated number of hubs instead of costly 
		city- and continent-hopping. These are but a few glimmers of the future world 
		of “touring” that underscore an increasingly urgent imperative: in all their 
		deliberations, cultural policy makers and decision makers today, not to mention artists and production teams, <span>must tackle the carbon footprint of performance.</span>

		<p class="indent-all"> 
		<spantitolo> OWN <br> THE STREAM </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p> 
		Next comes the question of live streaming, the most widespread default upon which cultural 
		institutions and performers have relied during the pandemic lockdown. But let’s 
		enfold within the notion of the “stream” all of those modes of dissemination that enable the 
		location- and site-specific to travel in space and time; and let’s understand the word “ownership” 
		in the expanded sense of “embrace,” “recognize,” and “assume responsibility for.”
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		As a surrogate for liveness and onsite experience, live streaming has <span>a unique potential 
		to democratize and de-localize</span> otherwise costly or inaccessible cultural forms. 
		It is certain to play a key role in the future of performance. But not as a mere add-on 
		or compromised surrogate for liveness. And not without fundamental changes to existing models of ownership and revenue generation. (As even highly successful artists have 
		discovered in the course of the pandemic, art today cannot live by streaming alone). 
		And also not without addressing the profound asymmetries that exist between nations, regions, and generations when it comes to access to broadband, asymmetries that 
		compromise the future of the performing arts.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		To simply broadcast performances that were designed for certain 
		spaces and on certain scales without adapting or altering them is not 
		an innovation that taps into the depth or breadth of the digital 
		media revolution. At best, it is like pouring old wine into new bottles. 
		At worst, it adulterates the quality of the wine. Streaming fulfils its 
		promise by reflecting creatively or critically on its specificity, capabilities, and affordances as <span>a new cultural medium.</span> That means exploring a new universe of online experience that is fundamentally different from the onsite even when the two intersect. And intersect they can. This point 
		of intersection needs to be explored differentially as <span>a value-added 
		proposition, enriching and animating both online and onsite experiences.</span>
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		For streaming to become a key expression of liveness plus, 
		the stream must become <span>a fully integral feature of every 
		performance</span>, no less integral or material than the site 
		of performance, the company, the performers, the atmosphere.
		Accordingly, it needs to become part of the conceptual and 
		physical infrastructure of every future stage.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		“Own the stream” means multiple things: from the standpoint of audience, engage with 
		the stream as an integral feature of every performance; from the standpoint of economics, 
		<span>make the stream support content creation, creators, and performers</span> through new business models; from the architectural standpoint, hardwire the stream’s production into every 
		future stage in as dynamic, futureproofed a way as is possible.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		Owning the stream is a multilayered endeavor. It implies inclusivity, 
		co-creation, and democratization, but most of all a reconceptualization 
		and redistribution of both actual and symbolic capital.

		<spantitolo> NEW FUNDING <br> MODELS </spantitolo>
		</p>
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		Performing arts financing is broken; broken in a multitude of ways. It innovates as
		an afterthought. It allocates resources asymmetrically, on the basis of precedent,
		often with scant regard for shifting demographics and societal change. 
		Instead of thinking ahead, it thinks backward. And it underestimates the role 
		of cultural institutions as drivers of value creation beyond local and regional 
		economic development.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		What needs to be reinvented? Most everything.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– <span>Public funding remains as essential as ever</span> because the future stage demands innovation (the costs associated with building
		state-of-the-art new venues or revitalizing old stages will NEVER 
		be captured by ticket revenues alone).
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– The precondition for public funding must be not tradition or precedent, but <span>INNOVATION and NEW AUDIENCE BUILDING.</span> Too many of the most august institutions in the performing arts have become backward looking and self-referential, and there’s an urgent need for participatory and community-based mechanisms for the allocation of resources at the local and national level, as well as for imaginative 
		thinking about both local and international partnerships.
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– Private funding is more welcome than ever: not to replace 
		public funding but instead to complement it (and especially 
		<span>to serve as an agent of disruption and revitalization).</span>
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– The fiscal regimes that govern the performing arts sector are out of date, focusing 
		on local value-creation (for our city, our region etc.). Rarely, if ever, do they tap into 
		<span>the full range of potential revenue streams</span>, leaving money on the table, 
		most often to the detriment of artists (too often treated as mere “cost-factors”).
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– Most Value Added Tax systems class the performing arts as a luxury good
		(that’s just plain wrong: PERFORMANCE IS AN <span>ESSENTIAL GOOD).</span>
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all">
		–  Sponsorship models remain sclerotic, ill-suited to current needs. 
		The time for contributing money in return for featuring corporate 
		logos is past. <span>New partnership models</span> are needed that create genuine 
		value both for sponsors and recipients of sponsor funds.
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– Innovation in financing and intellectual property rights management is urgently 
		needed <span>(it’s time to experiment with alternative models from crowdfunding to 
		decentralized autonomous organizations and/or NFTs).</span>
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all">
		What will happen if new funding models aren’t embraced to build, support, and sustain the 
		future stage? Physical venues will languish. Future audiences will gradually abandon them. They will come to know the performing arts on the screen alone. BUT <span>the screen and 
		the stream are the best friends of the future stage:</span> the very means by which liveness can 
		be reinvented and renewed in its foundational role ...as liveness plus.

		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– THE FUTURE STAGE DEMANDS NEW ARCHITECTURAL, ORGANIZATIONAL,
		AND HUMAN INFRASTRUCTURES (new physical plants, new funding models, new
		professional roles).
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– LIVENESS PLUS IS THE NORM ON THE FUTURE STAGE (let’s double down and
		build an ecosystem that promotes inclusivity, enhanced access, and reduced
		costs, along with participatory modes of performance and audience interaction).
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– FUTURE AUDIENCES FOR THE FUTURE STAGE (they need to be cultivated, 
		they need to be welcomed, only fresh approaches to programming will 
		bring them into being).
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– STREAMING IS A CREATIVE MEDIUM (NOT A SUPPORT) ON THE FUTURE
		STAGE (let’s explore its medium-specificity).
		</p>
		
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		– THE FUTURE STAGE DEMANDS BETTER, FAIRER, MORE CREATIVE DIGITAL
		PLATFORMS (in support of content creators and audience participation; platforms
		that promote equitable and distributed ownership models for cultural content).
		</p>
		
		<p> 
		– Like the stages of the past, THE FUTURE STAGE REQUIRES BOTH PUBLIC 
		AND PRIVATE FUNDING BUT WITH A RAZOR-SHARP FOCUS ON BUILDING NEW
		AUDIENCES.
		</p>
	
		<p class="indent-all"> 
		<span>...most important of all...</span> <br> <br>
		THE FUTURE STAGE IS NOW (there can be no post-pandemic return to the old
		“normal,” which was already broken; the time for courage, vision, and action is
		NOW).<br><br><br>
